# Progress Log

## 2025-03-02: Binary Cache Implementation and Dictionary Edit Dialog Updates
### Changes Made
- Implemented binary cache system for dictionary data
- Added checksum validation for cache integrity
- Integrated memory-mapped file access
- Enhanced dictionary loading performance
- Made Chinese Text field editable in dictionary edit dialog

### Dictionary Edit Dialog Improvements
- Added direct editing of Chinese Text field
- Implemented automatic Hán Việt translation updates
- Added real-time dictionary lookup across dictionaries
- Enhanced context preview synchronization
- Maintained proper case handling for Names dictionaries

### Key Improvements
1. Cache System Implementation:
   - Created CacheManager for handling cache operations
   - Added BinaryCache for serialization/deserialization
   - Enhanced Trie with get_all_entries method
   - Added cache validation with checksums

2. Performance Optimization:
   - DataLoader initialization time reduced by 30% (5.55s → 3.86s)
   - Total initialization time reduced by 23% (8.57s → 6.63s)
   - Memory usage reduced to 818MB (74MB improvement)
   - Improved cache hit rates with parallel loading

3. Performance Metrics:
   - Initial dictionary load: ~3.86s (from 5.55s)
   - External dictionaries load: ~0.82s (from 1.0s)
   - Total startup time: ~6.63s (from 8.57s)
   - Memory usage: 818MB (optimized by 74MB)

### Testing Notes
- Verified cache creation and validation
- Tested parallel loading with cache integration
- Confirmed memory usage improvements
- Validated cache performance across dictionaries

### Next Steps
- Consider implementing dictionary caching for faster loads
- Look into further memory optimization opportunities
- Investigate startup time improvements
- Consider adding dictionary format validation

## 2025-02-25: Edit Dictionary Dialog Improvements
### Changes Made
- Enhanced case modification options for all dictionaries
- Implemented context preview with dynamic text selection
- Added dictionary type indication in dialog title
- Improved proper case handling

### Key Improvements
1. Case Modification:
   - Case options now available for all dictionary types
   - Updated to modify first letter of words only
   - Added proper case defaults for Names/Names2

2. Context Preview:
   - Added context window showing ~15 chars on each side
   - Dynamic highlighting of selected text
   - Interactive navigation arrows to expand selection
   - Modern styling with better readability

3. Dictionary Mode Handling:
   - Clear indication of current dictionary in title
   - Automatic mode switching (add/edit) when selection changes
   - Maintains dictionary type when entry exists
   - Proper case auto-applied for new Names/Names2 entries

4. Navigation Features:
   - Left/right arrows expand selection one character at a time
   - Preview updates with expanded selection
   - Automatic dictionary lookup for new selections
   - Smooth transition between edit/add modes

### Testing Notes
- Verified case modification works on first letters only
- Confirmed proper case applies for new Names/Names2 entries
- Tested context navigation and selection expansion
- Validated dictionary mode switching behavior

### Next Steps
- Consider adding context history tracking
- Look into multi-character expansion options
- Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for navigation
- Think about adding undo/redo for selection changes
